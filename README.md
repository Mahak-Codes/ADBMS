# Advanced DBMS - Winter Winning Camp

This repository contains SQL exercises and solutions from the **Winter Winning Camp**, covering SQL queries, joins, subqueries, set operations, stored procedures, functions, and triggers. It will be extended with additional DBMS topics and projects after the camp to continue enhancing SQL skills and knowledge.

## Syllabus Overview

The following topics were covered as part of the Winter Winning Camp:

- **Introduction to DQL, DDL, DML, DCL**: Understanding different types of SQL commands:
  - **DQL (Data Query Language)** - `SELECT`
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language)** - `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - **DCL (Data Control Language)** - `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
  
- **Joins in SQL**: Implementing various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, etc.) to retrieve data from multiple tables.
  
- **Sub-Queries in SQL**: Writing and optimizing subqueries for complex data retrieval operations.

- **Set Operations in SQL**: Using `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` to combine results from multiple queries.
  
- **Stored Procedures in SQL**: Creating and using stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic and enhance database performance.
  
- **Functions in SQL**: Writing built-in and custom functions to perform specific operations on data.
  
- **Triggers and its Types in SQL**: Implementing triggers to automatically respond to certain database events like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- **Miscellaneous Problem Statements**: Solving various real-world SQL problems and queries based on the topics learned.
